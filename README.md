# Navigation Folder Structure using Angular

This project allow devs to create navigation which is deeply nested to each other

## Components

This is only a simple project which has two components

- Main-layout: Component to create layout using Ant-Design
- Menu: This Component uses a navigation array injected by MenuService, then extract the file into navs column recursively

```typescript
<ul nz-menu [nzMode]="'vertical'" *ngFor="let folder of navFolders">

    <app-folder [folder]="folder"></app-folder>

</ul>
```

- folder: A component which contains content for subfolder, as well as it own "folder" component triggering, this is crucial for the whole navs to work

The hierarchy of folder can be looked like

```

## Below is the doc generated by framework

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
